## Introduction

The concept of asking smart questions in software engineering is geared to emphasize the importance of effective and clear communication to aid in the development process. I have found various examples of both smart and not-smart questions on StackOverflow, and I will provide a clear analysis of my point. Smart questions are the backbone for efficient thinking and problem-solving, getting faster and more accurate responses, and fostering collaboration between developers. The essay will demonstrate the comparison between a smart and not smart question and explore the impact on the response in regard to quality and the problem-solving process overall.

## Understanding Smart Questions

Based on the rubric of Eric Raybomd's "How to Ask Questions the Smart Way," smart questions are clear and concise and provide substantial evidence and context to help developers respond to and offer meaningful solutions. Smart questions remove various factors that may affect the process of troubleshooting errors. Smart questions require that effort be shown to avoid vagueness and that you provide relevant details about the issue that may be occurring. I think it might be helpful to provide attempts and ways you have solved it on your own. 

The key characteristics of smart questions are reliant on a few things provided clearly in Raymond's guidelines. Key characteristics must include a clear problem definition that is as specific as possible and explain the issue in detail. It must also provide context and relevant information about the technology stack and issue. With that comes effort and research, with the developer having shown their efforts to problem solve by researching or attempting different solutions before looking to other developers for help. It should also be as polite and professional as possible, with the willingness to hear and appreciate the responders' time and efforts.

## Example of a Smart question

"How can I make a React and Firebase web app more secure?"

Link to example found on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79298162/how-can-i-make-a-react-and-firebase-web-app-more-secure

Summary of question: The developer ass for advice on improving the security of a React and Firebase web app, focusing on legal data protection requirements. They provide clear context about the use of the database for authentication, and technologies included in the process. They mention their consideration of implementing SSO, Single Sign-on. The question is clear and specific, demonstrating an effort to problem-solve and making a perfect example of a smart question. 

This smart question was a perfect demonstration of adherence to Raymond's guidelines. With this question came clear problem definition, context, effort, and politeness. The question was clearly defined, with the focus being on security and compliance. The developer mentioned the technology stack and purpose of the app, giving other developers more context to provide subtantially reliable advice. They also mentioned their thought process behind implementing Single Sign-on (SSO) and other security measures, which indicated that they had researched other possible solutions before inquiring further. The question ended with a simple acknowledgment of a "thank you" to set a positive tone for engagement. 

The response to this question from the expert was helpful and suggestive, using Firebase Security Rules to define roles and implement access control. In addition to using Firebase functions for auditing purposes, the answer directly addressed the question and provided practical and implementable advice to the developer. 

## Example of a lesser, not-smart question

"Failed to fetch-"

Link to example found on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79298265/failed-to-fetch

Summary of question: The developer encounters an issue with the "Failed to Fetch" error when trying to upload a file using the Javascript Fetch API to a C# web API. They share snippets of code but offer minimal context or details surrounding this error. The question lacks specific troubleshooting steps or an explanation of server-side setup. It makes for an extremely hard to diagnose not-smart way of asking a question.

The problem definition was extremely vague. The question did not clearly explain what was failing or provide sufficient details or evidence regarding the error. The developer refers to sources they've read but doesn't explain how they implemented that information to bypass the cause of failure in their code. There is an extreme lack of effort, The developer mensions that theyve read related guides, but dont describe the steps they took to troubleshoot or narrow down the issue. With this came poor structure and formatting of their question, demonstrating that it was not organized clearly and lacked important debugging details such as server-side configuration or specific error codes.

The response elicited everything wrong with their post, inquiry for help, and pointed out key flaws. They stated that the developer is not using FormData or file uploads, which suggests that the headers might be misconfigured. The answer then highlights that the question could have been more effective if better structured. 

## Differences between smart and not-smart questions

There are some key differences between the two questions and the responses that were prompted by them. Clarity and specificity were some of the most notable differences, as the smart question is clear and specific, and the not-smart question is vague and lacks necessary details. There were also key differences in the provided context and background of the smart question, as well as research and effort overall, including structure and formatting. There is a clear difference between the responses that came from either posed question as well. The impact on response quality differed between each question as well, as the smart question leads to efficient and helpful responses while the lesser question results in vague, less helpful responses or criticism. 

## Takeaway

There is a good takeaway from this, coming from both a professional and a personal aspect. Smart questions improve both the chances of receiving effective rapid responses as well as maintaining productive communication in collaborative environments. They encourage the critical analysis of code and problems they are being proposed with, as well as how to communicate them clearly. 

As software engineers, we are supposed to think critically and analytically and be able to ask clear, concise, well-researched questions to further our program development. It is a crucial step in the process of being a developer, amongst others. Learning from both smart and not smart examples can help guide me in the right direction of communication in future collaborations and interactions between peers. 

## Conclude
In summary, I think it is important to note the importance of smart questions and how things can be proposed to get adequate responses or collaboration from other developers. The benefits of asking clear, concise, well-researched, and structured questions foster collaboration. The principles of asking smart questions lead to more effective problem-solving and better communication in the software engineering field. In future applications, it is important to reflect on how applying smart questioning techniques will both improve personal learning and collaborative problem-solving in the future.
