🎶 **Manoa’s Got Music**  
_A place for the musically minded of UH to meet and coordinate_

### Overview

**The Problem:**  
Many UH students are musically talented, but lack an easy way to find others with similar tastes and compatible musical abilities. This prevents informal jam sessions and the formation of musical groups.

**The Solution:**  
Manoa’s Got Music is a web application that allows students to:

- Create a profile with their musical tastes, skills, and goals  
- Share links to performances (YouTube/SoundCloud)  
- Connect with other students for collaboration or jam sessions  

---

### Technologies Used

- **Next.js** – TypeScript-based framework  
- **React** – Component-based UI  
- **React Bootstrap** – Styling framework  
- **React Hook Form** – Form management  
- **Prisma** – Type-safe ORM for database  

---

### Project Goals

- Foster musical collaboration among UH students  
- Enable exploration of new genres and instruments  
- Make it easy to find compatible musicians for jamming or bands
